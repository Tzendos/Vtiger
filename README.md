See [Third Party App Integration (REST APIs)](http://community.vtiger.com/help/vtigercrm/developers/third-party-app-integration.html)

## Installation, Configuration and Usage

### Installing
1. In order to install the Vtiger package in your Laravel project, just run the composer require command from your terminal:

    ```
    composer require "tzendos/vtiger ^1.0"
    ```

    > *If you are using Laravel >= 5.5 you don’t need to do steps 2 and 3.*

2. Then in your config/app.php add the following to the providers array:

    ```
    Clystnet\Vtiger\VtigerServiceProvider::class,
    ```

3. In the same config/app.php add the following to the aliases array:

    ```
    'Vtiger' => Clystnet\Vtiger\Facades\Vtiger::class,
    ```

4. Publish the configuration file:

    ```
    php artisan vendor:publish --tag="vtiger"
    ```

### Configuration

- In Vtiger, create a new or select an existing user.
- Under *User Advanced Options* make note of the *username* and *access key*.
- In your application, edit *config/vtiger.php* and replace the following array values
  - Set the url to the https://{DOMAIN_NAME}/webservice.php
  - Set the username and accesskey with your CRM username and access key.
  - Set persistconnection to false if you want a fresh login with each request

    |key              |value                                |
    |-----------------|-------------------------------------|
    |url              |http://www.example.com/webservice.php|
    |username         |API                                  |
    |accesskey        |irGsy9HB0YOZdEA                      |
    |persistconnection|true                                 |
    |max_retries      |10                                   |

> Because I've experienced problems getting the sessionid from the CRM when multiple users are accessing the CRM at the same time, the solution was to store the sessionid into a file within Laravel application.
> Instead of getting the token from the database for each request using the webservice API, a check is made against the expiry time in the file. If the expiry time has expired, a token is requested from the CRM and file is updated with the new token and updated expiry time.

### Usage

In your controller include the Vtiger package
```php
use Vtiger;
```

#### Create

To insert a record into the CRM, first create an array of data to insert. Don't forget the added the id of the `assigned_user_id` (i.e. '4x12') otherwise the insert will fail as `assigned_user_id` is a mandatory field.
```php
$data = array(
    'assigned_user_id' => '',
);
```
To do the actual insert, pass the module name along with the json encoded array to the *create* function.

```php
Vtiger::create($MODULE_NAME, json_encode($data));
```

#### Retrieve

To retrieve a record from the CRM, you need the id of the record you want to find (i.e. '4x12').
```php
$id = '4x12';

$obj = Vtiger::retrieve($id);

// do someting with the result
var_dump($obj);
```

#### Update

The easiest way to update a record in the CRM is to retrieve the record first.
```php
$id = '4x12';

$obj = Vtiger::retrieve($id);
```

Then update the object with updated data.
```php
$obj->result->field_name = 'Your new value';

$update = Vtiger::update($obj->result);
```

#### Delete

To delete a record from the CRM, you need the id of the record you want to delete (i.e. '4x12').
```php
$id = '4x12';

$obj = Vtiger::retrieve($id);

// do someting with the result
var_dump($obj);
```

#### Search

This function is a sql query builder wrapped around the query function. Accepts instance of laravels QueryBuilder.
```php
$query = DB::table('Leads')->select('id', 'firstname', 'lastname')->where('firstname', 'John');

$obj = Vtiger::search('Leads', $query);

//loop over result
foreach($obj->result as $result) {
    // do something
}
```

By default the function will quote but not escape your inputs, if you wish for your data to not be quoted, set the 3rd paramater to false like so:
```php
$obj = Vtiger::search('Leads', $query, false);
```

Also keep in mind that Vtiger has several limitations on it's sql query capabilities. You can not use conditional grouping i.e "where (firstname = 'John' AND 'lastname = 'Doe') OR (firstname = 'Jane' AND lastname = 'Smith') will fail.


#### Query

To use the [Query Operation](http://community.vtiger.com/help/vtigercrm/developers/third-party-app-integration.html#query-operation), you first need to create a SQL query.
```php
$query = "SELECT * FROM ModuleName;";
```

Then run the query...
```php
$obj = Vtiger::query($query);

//loop over result
foreach($obj->result as $result) {
    // do something
}
```

### Describe

To describe modules in the CRM run this with the module name

```php
$moduleDescription = (Vtiger:describe("Contacts"))->result;
```
